 Using Seaborn and Python to analyse and visualise Pokemon Gen1 data

## Overview of Seaborn
Matplotlib is a potent but somewhat cumbersome Python visualisation toolkit, and Seaborn offers a high-level interface to it.

According to Seaborn's official website:

While Seaborn aims to "make a well-defined set of hard things easy," Matplotlib "tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible."

This is a pretty decent description of Seaborn's positive attributes, in our opinion. The "well-defined set of hard things" in actuality consists of:

<ul>
<li>using attractively pleasing default themes.</li>
<li>creating personalised colour palettes.</li>
<li>creating visually appealing statistical charts.</li>
<li>showing distributions in a simple and flexible way.</li>
<li>displaying data from dataframes and matrices.</li>
</ul>

The use of Seaborn as our go-to tool for exploratory analysis is due to these last three considerations. It makes it incredibly simple to rapidly and effectively "get to know" your data.
